A dart library that reads and writes [Intel HEX files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX).
Intel HEX is a file format that is used to store binary data as ASCII text. It is often used
to program microcontrollers. The file format comprises record blocks. Each record is a line in
the hex file. The record start at the ":" character and ends at the end of the line. The last
byte of a line is the checksum of all other bytes.

A record has six fields:

  - Start code. Usually ":".
  - Byte count
  - Address
  - Record type
  - Data. May be empty.
  - Checksum.

## Features

This library supports both reading and writing Intel HEX files.
Any comments in the files (or leading characters, empty lines) are ignored.
Line lengths from 1 to 255 bytes are supported.

The following record types can be parsed:

| Record type     | Id   | Description |
| ---------   | -------------------------------  | ----------- |
| Data | 00 | A data field with the contents of the file. |
| End Of File  | 01 | The parser stops once an End Of File record is found. |
| Extended Segment Address | 02 | A data field with an extended address that is added to the address all following data records. Allows addressing up to 1 MB. |
| Start Segment Address  | 03 | A data field that holds the initial intruction pointer for 80x86 CPUs. |
| Extended Linear Address | 04 | A data field that contains the upper 16 bits of the addresses for all subsequent data fields. Allows using up to 4 GB. |
| Start Linear Address  | 05 | Starting execution address for CPUs that support it. |

## Getting started

To use the package, simply add it to your pupspec.yaml:
```yaml
dependencies:
  intel_hex: ^1.0.0
```

And you are good to go!

## Usage

Here is a simple example showing how to read a file:

```dart
import 'package:intel_hex/intel_hex.dart';

// example reading a file ...
final file = File(path).readAsStringSync();
var hex = IntelHexFile.fromString(file);
```

Converting binary data to an Intel HEX string can be done with the following code:
```dart
import 'package:intel_hex/intel_hex.dart';

Uint8List data = /* get binary data */;
var hex = IntelHexFile.fromData(data);
var hexString = hex.toFileContents();
```
